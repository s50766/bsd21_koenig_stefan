Logging is used to record and trace error states of the software process. Since evaluation by administrators and software developers is intended and the content is subject to legal restrictions, no confidential information may be included.

Log levels are a mechanism to categorise logs. Levels used for identifying the severity of an event.
The loglevels are ALL < TRACE < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL.
