# Calculator with args by Stefan KÃ¶nig
## A Java program from this semester.

### This semester we made a simple calculator that gets the numbers and the operators via args.

## How to install this program?
First you have to download and unzip the folder. Then just open it in your IDE and open the java file in the src folder.

## How is this project used?
It uses java to calculate the numbers and operators.
````
        double number1 = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
        String operator = args[1];
        double number2 = Double.parseDouble(args[2]);
        double result;
````
This code shows how each variable will be filled from the args array.
Then a simple if and else if construct calculates and if needed throws an exception.
````
        if (operator.equals("*")) {
            result = number1 * number2;
        } else if (operator.equals("/")){
            result = number1 / number2;
        } else if (operator.equals("+")){
            result = number1 + number2;
        } else if (operator.equals("-")){
            result = number1 - number2;
        } else {
            throw new java.lang.Error("Error - arguments must be of type NUMBER1 {'*'|'/'|'+'|'-'} NUMBER2");
        }
        System.out.println(number1 + operator + number2 + " = " + result);
    }
````

I made this as an exercise and of course the code shown above can be edited, but it should work fine.

For logging inside the maven project, i made a log4j2.xml.template for everyone as a template.


Down here i will post my exercise links.
