# How to write good source code comments and git commit messages:

For good git commit messages you should keep 7 rules in mind.

1. Line between summary/heading and main text
2. Short summary/heading less than 50 characters
3. Short summary/heading start with capital letter
4. No . at end of short summary/heading
5. Use imperative mood in summary
6. Main text should lone break after 72 characters
7. In main text describe what and why not how

# Keep best practices in mind for writing good comments:
1. Nothing can be so helpful as a well-placed comment
2. Good comments do not excuse unclear code
3. If you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with your code.
4. Comments should despel confusion, not cause it
5. Explain unidiomatic in comments
6. Provide links to the original source of copied code
7. Include links to external references where they will be most helpful
8. Add comments when fixing bugs
9. Use comments to mark incomplete implementations
